Golang Backend API Project

Overview

This project is a robust and scalable backend API built using Go (Golang), designed to provide a foundation for modern web applications. It follows a modular architecture with clean code practices, making it easy to maintain, extend, and deploy. The API is designed to handle various functionalities such as user management, authentication, and data processing, with a focus on performance and reliability.

Features





RESTful API: Implements standard RESTful endpoints for seamless integration with front-end applications.



Database Integration: Configured to work with a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL) for persistent data storage.



Middleware Support: Includes middleware for authentication, logging, and request validation.



Modular Structure: Organized into packages (api-test, db, middlewares, models, routes, utils) for clear separation of concerns.



Dependency Management: Uses Go modules (go.mod and go.sum) for managing external libraries.



Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms to ensure reliability and graceful failure.

Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:





Go: Version 1.16 or higher



Database: SQLite



Git: For cloning the repository



A working internet connection for downloading dependencies

Installation





Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/syedajaibalizaidi/golang-backend-api-project.git
cd golang-backend-api-project



Install dependencies:

go mod tidy



Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and configure the necessary variables, such as:

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=your_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=your_database
PORT=8080



Run the application:

go run main.go

The API will be available at http://localhost:8080 (or the port specified in your .env file).

Usage





API Endpoints: The API routes are defined in the routes/ directory. Refer to the specific route files for available endpoints and their functionalities.



Testing: Use the api-test/ directory to run tests or create custom test scripts.



Extending the API: Add new models in the models/ directory, define routes in the routes/ directory, and implement business logic in the appropriate packages.
